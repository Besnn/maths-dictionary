# Maths Dictionary

As part of an ongoing project on categorical translation, I'm building a multilingual dictionary of mathematical terminology.
You can see the live website version at https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary/ .

If you would like to contribute a few words, then use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxROn89utMb6NwsM4H6hbOcTtw2NzjLXztmrBinyQwGeZPSg/viewform); if you would like to do some larger contribution, then just contact me for a little chat.

## Todo

- language .json files should have LTR/RTL information
    + this should be used when displaying adjectives!
    + should also be reflected in `text-align` in the css
- fix errors with the `DE` entries
    + think about how to deal with grammatical case...
- regional variations?
    + especially with `ES`
- add plurals of nouns (and thus adjectives)
- link each entry (incl. adjectives) to a definition? wikipedia page or something...
- get language selectors (in `index.html`) from the language `.json` files
    + should also get endonyms from there too

(<https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html> is useful)
