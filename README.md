# Maths Dictionary

As part of an ongoing project on categorical translation, I'm building a multilingual dictionary of mathematical terminology.

If you would like to contribute a few words, then use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxROn89utMb6NwsM4H6hbOcTtw2NzjLXztmrBinyQwGeZPSg/viewform); if you would like to do some larger contribution, then just contact me for a little chat.

## Todo

- make `index.html`
    + see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44279919/reading-json-file-from-github-pages-server-using-javascript)
- fix errors with the `DE` entries
    + think about how to deal with grammatical case...
- regional variations?
    + especially with `ES`
- add plurals of nouns (and thus adjectives)
